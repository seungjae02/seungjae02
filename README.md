title: "Font Awesome in R Markdown"
output: html_document

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE} 
library(fontawesome)
```

# Just a few tests with `r fa("font-awesome-logo-full", fill = "forestgreen")`

It works well in headings...

# `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` H1 Heading

## `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` H2 Heading

### `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` H3 Heading

#### `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` H4 Heading

##### `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` H5 Heading
